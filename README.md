This project was tasked to meet the following criteria:

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Things I learned in making this portfolio:
  - Creating a physical wireframe actually helps in understanding how different sections and divs interact
  - Starting from scratch poses different challenges than working on someone else's code
  - Flexboxes are phenomenal, they really helped reduce the need for as many media queries
  - I should walk away when I get stuck. If I haven't made a breakthrough on something and am still stuck after 45 minutes, I should get up and take a break.
  - Reaching out for help is essential! I should use my resources, including people in class. We are in this together!
  - Once the "aha!" moment happens and things click, coding can be fun.
